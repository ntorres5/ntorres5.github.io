<h1>Our First Travel Adventure</h1>
<p><i>Hello, Imaddy. Keep checking back for updates!</i></p>
<p>The first project in the Harvard course has me creating a simple webpage, from scratch.</p>
<p>A way to channel creativity into something - something I hope you will enjoy.</p>
<p>I'll clean up the formatting later cause that's not the meat and potatoes - the content is.</p>

<h5>Day 1 - Kinda nervous</h5>
<p>The plane is packed and the last thing we need is to get sick.</p>
<p>My mind is racing - Are we going to get checked when we land? What if we have to quarantine?</p>
<p>I need to practice my spanish. And my dancing. Dedicate more time towards both - noted.</p>
<p>I love those jeans on her. Her sweater and little stripes - pretty cute too.</p>
<p>I haven't worked out in 6 months, I'm going to look terrible in a bathing suit.</p>
<p>I can't wait to get past security, get the car, and unwind, with my girl.</p>
<p>If an opportunity comes up to do karaoke, we in there fam.</p>
<p>I pray this trip brings us closer, together. So many things I want to say.</p>
<p>So many places I want to see, with her. Places I want to experience, with her.</p>
<p>Kinda nervous.</p>

<h5>Day 2 – Not so nervous</h5>
<p> Last night didn’t begin quite as expected - everything was closed and dinner was a not so authentic pizza. The ending, however, was perfect - safe, together, and in each others arms.</p>
<p>It’s a new day though, with new adventures ahead. We shared a huge plate of salt, accompanied by some rice, meat and tostones. We ventured Old San Juan and went to a relaxing beach resort. La placita was fun and wasn’t as packed as I expected. You managed to sneak your drink into a club that allowed drinks to be brought in – good job babe. You wore your tequila por favor shirt and green shorts – you looked perfect. Things got a little wild on the drive home last night with the twerk videos – I loved it. Everyone was so happy.</p>
<p>Not so nervous</p>

<h5>Day 3 – As long as we’re together</h5>
<p>I got to visit my family in the morning, and then we were off to find food and explore. We managed to find some over sized drinks after eating at the Manolin in Old San Juan. Our pictures at the I love PR sign could not have come out more perfect. Next was to visit Eddie’s family. A long drive, but I had you by my side – so it didn’t matter what the plans were. </p>
<p>As long as we’re together.</p>

 <h5>Day 4 – How is it already day 4?</h5>
<p>Time to check out and explore one last time. The Condado Vanderbuilt was stunning and I’m low key already planning our trip back to stay there – just me and you. You and I. Every drink on the list. We got this. Keep em comin’. We wore our matching PR shirts and dreadfully rushed back to the airport after a few drinks at WBC. I think this plane ride back is what got us sick – we should have stayed in Puerto Rico. Although a lot was closed, the group had fun. I couldn’t wait to get home and snuggle up next to you, at home. </p>
<p>How is it already day 4?</p>
<p>Amor, I hate that I put you in a position to question my intentions, and I wish I can reverse time to remove any doubts you have. I want to grow with you. I want to travel with you. Create unforgettable moments with you. I want to and will always support you in every single way possible - to make you more comfortable, to make your dreams come true. You are right, I am go with the flow with you, but it’s only because all I want to do is see you happy. </p>
<p>I’m falling in love with you, and continue to fall deeper the more time we spend together. The more I learn about you. Your tendencies. Your smile. I love how you cannot wink both eyes, but always put your best foot forward and try anyways. I love your head movements when we talk. I love that you love music just as much as I do. I love the softness you have in your eyes, and the little wing you make with your eyeliner – it always goes slightly up. At one point during the trip I was standing next to you, holding you, with a beautiful view in front of us, and all I could do is stare… at you.  I love how caring you are – with your friends, your family, Athena, Dolce, me, my family. I love your creativity and thoughtfulness. I love that you are down for adventuring with me and always open to trying new things, except scuba diving. I love when you say “ayy amor” and when you think and say “ehmm”. I love that you collect your thoughts, and compose yourself, before speaking to ensure what you want to say comes across correctly. I love your drive and work ethic. I love you laying on my chest, in your favorite spot; it’s my favorite place for you to be. I love how physical you are, even though physical touch is your 4th love language. People search their whole lives to find what we have already found. Take my hand, and let’s prove forever exists. </p>
