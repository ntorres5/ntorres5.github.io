<h1>Our First Travel Adventure</h1>
<p>The first project in the Harvard course has me creating a simple webpage, <i>from scratch.</i></p>
<p>A way to channel creativity into something - something I hope you will enjoy.</p>

<h5>Day 1 - Kinda nervous</h5>
<p>The plane is packed and the last thing we need is to get sick.</p>
<p>My mind is racing - Are we going to get checked when we land? What if we have to quarantine?</p>
<p>I need to practice my spanish. And my dancing. Dedicate more time towards both - noted.</p>
<p>I love those jeans on her. Her sweater and little stripes - pretty cute too.</p>
<p>I haven't worked out in 6 months, I'm going to look terrible in a bathing suit.</p>
<p>I can't wait to get past security, get the car, and unwind, with my girl.</p>
<p>If an opportunity comes up to do karaoke, we in there fam.</p>
<p>I pray this trip brings us closer, together. So many things I want to say.</p>
<p>So many places I want to see, with her. Places I want to experience, with her.</p>
<p><b>Kinda nervous.</p></b>

<h5>Day 2 – Not so nervous</h5>
<p> Last night didn’t begin quite as expected -</p>
<p>Everything was closed and dinner was a not so authentic pizza.</p>
<p>The ending, however, was perfect - safe, together, and in each others arms.</p>
<p>It’s a new day though, with new adventures ahead -</p>
<p>We shared a huge plate of salt, accompanied by some rice, meat and tostones.</p>
<p>We ventured through Old San Juan and went to a relaxing beach resort.</p>
<p>La placita was fun and wasn’t as packed as I expected:</p>
<p>You managed to sneak your drink into a club that allowed drinks to be brought in – good job babe.</p>
<p>You wore your tequila por favor shirt and green shorts – you looked perfect.</p>
<p>Things got a little dicey on the drive home at night with the twerk videos – I loved it.</p>
<p>Everyone was so happy.</p>
<p><b>Not so nervous</p></b>

<h5>Day 3 – As long as we’re together</h5>
<p>I got to visit my family in the morning, and then we were off to find food and explore.</p>
<p>We managed to find some over sized drinks after eating at the Manolin in Old San Juan.</p>
<p>Our pictures at the I love PR sign could not have come out more perfect.</p>
<p>Next was to visit Eddie’s family. A long drive, but I had you by my side.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter what the plans were.</p>
<p><b>As long as we’re together.</p></b>

<h5>Day 4 – How is it already day 4?</h5>
<p>Time to check out and explore one last time.</p>
<p>The Condado Vanderbuilt was stunning and I’m low key already planning our trip back to stay there</p>
<p>Just me and you. You and I. Every drink on the list. We got this. Keep em comin’.</p>
<p>We wore our matching PR shirts and dreadfully rushed back to the airport after a few drinks at WBC.</p>
<p>I think this plane ride back is what got us sick – we should have stayed in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Although a lot was closed, the group had fun. I couldn’t wait to get home and snuggle up next to you, at home. </p>

<p>Amor, I hate that I put you in a position to question my intentions, and I wish I can reverse time to remove any doubts you have. I want to grow with you. I want to travel with you. Create unforgettable moments with you. I want to and will always support you in every single way possible - to make you more comfortable, to make your dreams come true. You are right, I am go with the flow with you, but only because all I want to do is see you happy. </p>
<p>I’m falling in love with you, and continue to fall deeper the more time we spend together. The more I learn about you. Your tendencies. Your smile. I love how you cannot wink both eyes, but always put your best foot forward and try anyways. I love your head movements when we talk. I love that you love music just as much as I do. I love the softness you have in your eyes, and the little wing you make with your eyeliner – it always goes slightly up. At one point during the trip I was standing next to you, holding you, with a beautiful view in front of us, and all I could do is stare… at you.  I love how caring you are – with your friends, your family, Athena, Dolce, me, my family. I love your creativity and thoughtfulness. I love that you are down for adventuring with me and always open to trying new things, except scuba diving. I love when you say “ayy amor” and when you think and say “ehmm”. I love that you collect your thoughts, and compose yourself, before speaking to ensure what you want to say comes across correctly. I love that I can be myself around you. I love wrestling with you. I love your drive and work ethic. I love you laying on my chest, in your favorite spot; it’s my favorite place for you to be. I love how physical you are, even though physical touch is your 4th love language. Amor, people search their whole lives to find what we have already found - take my hand and I'll never let go. Let’s prove forever exists. </p>
