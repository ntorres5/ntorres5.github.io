<h1>Our First Travel Adventure</h1>
<p><i>Hello, Imaddy. Keep checking back for updates!</i></p>
<p>The first project in the Harvard course has me creating a simple webpage, from scratch.</p>
<p>A way to channel creativity into something - something I hope you will enjoy.</p>
<p>I'll clean up the formatting later cause that's not the meat and potatoes - the content is.</p>

<h5>Day 1 - Kinda nervous</h5>
<p>The plane is packed and the last thing we need is to get sick</p>
<p>My mind is racing - Are we going to get checked when we land? What if we have to quarantine?</p>
<p>I need to practice my spanish. And my dancing. Dedicate more time towards both - noted.</p>
<p>I love those jeans on her. Her sweater and little stripes - pretty cute too</p>
<p>I pray this trip brings us closer, together. So many things I want to say.</p>
<p>Kinda nervous.</p>
